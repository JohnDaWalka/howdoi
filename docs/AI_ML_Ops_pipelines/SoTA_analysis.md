# State of the Art Analysis on AI/ML Ops Pipelines at Hyperscalers

## Overview of Major Hyperscalers and Their AI/ML Ops Offerings

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a comprehensive suite of AI/ML Ops tools and services. These include Amazon SageMaker, AWS Glue, and AWS Step Functions. SageMaker provides a fully managed environment for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for machine learning. AWS Step Functions allow you to coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows, making it easier to build and manage complex machine learning pipelines.

### Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure provides a range of AI/ML Ops services through Azure Machine Learning. This includes tools for data preparation, model training, and deployment. Azure Machine Learning also offers MLOps capabilities, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for machine learning. Azure Databricks, a collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics service, is another key component of Azure's AI/ML Ops offerings.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers AI/ML Ops services through Google AI Platform. This includes tools for data preparation, model training, and deployment. Google AI Platform also provides MLOps capabilities, enabling CI/CD for machine learning. Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully managed stream and batch data processing service, is another key component of GCP's AI/ML Ops offerings.
